# bgp-hijacking
A BGP prefix hijacking attack scenario, and a countermeasure to the attack.

### Description

This is a Computer Networking course project based on a demo https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/BGP-Path-Hijacking-Attack-Demo. Here we created a more complex topology and attack scenario.

Also, I designed and implemented a countermeasure to this attack using both MD5 authorization and BGP route filtering mechanism.
